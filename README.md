## 📖 Executive Summary
The **AI College Predictor** is a sophisticated Machine Learning tool engineered to guide engineering aspirants in Karnataka through the complex admission landscape.

Unlike generic predictors that rely on static lookup tables, this system utilizes **Polynomial Regression** to model the non-linear relationship between raw marks and rank. It then cross-references this predicted rank against a high-precision database constructed from the **Official COMEDK 2025 Round 3 Allotment List** (Notified Aug 22, 2025).

The tool addresses the "Mark-to-Rank" ambiguity by training on difficulty-calibrated trend lines for **KCET, COMEDK, and JEE Main**, offering students a realistic probability assessment of securing seats in top-tier institutions like **RVCE, BMSCE, and MSRIT**.

## 🏗️ Step 1: The Prediction Engine (Machine Learning)
The core of the system is a `sklearn` pipeline that transforms raw marks into a predicted rank.

* **Algorithm:** Polynomial Regression (Degree 3).
* **Why Degree 3?** Rank distribution is not linear. A difference of 5 marks at the top (e.g., 175 vs 180) impacts rank far less than 5 marks in the middle (e.g., 90 vs 95). A 3rd-degree polynomial captures this "bell curve" density perfectly.
* **Training Data:** Calibrated using 2024-2025 paper difficulty statistics.

---

## 🗄️ Step 2: The Database (Official 2025 Cutoffs)
The backend database is a curated subset of the **2025 Round 3 Engineering Cutoff Ranks**.

* **Source:** Official Allotment PDF (22.08.2025).
* **Scope:** Covers Tier-1 (Global Placements), Tier-2 (High Value), and Tier-3 (Regional Leaders).
* **Granularity:** Includes specific branch cutoffs for CSE, ISE, ECE, AI & ML, and Data Science.

---

## 🧠 Step 3: The Recommendation Logic
The system applies a **"Safety Margin Classification"** to every prediction to categorize your chances:

* 🟢 **SAFE:** Your rank is **< 80%** of the cutoff (High Probability).
* 🟡 **LIKELY:** Your rank is **< 100%** of the cutoff (Moderate Probability).
* 🔴 **BORDERLINE:** Your rank is slightly above the cutoff (Requires Spot Round/Luck).

## 📊 Deep-Dive: 2025 Data Analysis
The project includes hard-coded intelligence derived from the 2025 admission cycle. Below are key insights integrated into the tool:

| Tier | Institution | Branch (CSE) Cutoff (Round 3) | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | **RV College of Engineering (RVCE)** | **542** | Extremely competitive. Closed under Rank 600. |
| **Tier 1** | **MS Ramaiah (MSRIT)** | **1,341** | Remains the top choice after RVCE. |
| **Tier 1** | **BMS College of Engineering** | **3,689** | Slightly higher cutoff, offering a wider window. |
| **Tier 2** | **Dayananda Sagar (DSCE)** | **5,479** | The "Golden Gate" for sub-5k rankers. |
| **Tier 2** | **Bangalore Inst. of Tech (BIT)** | **9,177** | Excellent value for ranks near 10k. |
| **Tier 2** | **CMR Institute of Tech (CMRIT)** | **18,084** | Major jump in cutoff, showing high demand. |
| **Tier 2** | **Sir M Visvesvaraya (Sir MVIT)** | **22,026** | A "Safe Harbor" for ranks between 20k-25k. |

> *Note: All ranks listed are COMEDK GM (General Merit) Cutoffs.*

## 💻 Installation & Usage

To run this analytics tool on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 📦 Step 1: Install Dependencies
We use `scikit-learn` for the Machine Learning model and `pandas` for high-performance data handling.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

⚙️ Step 2: Configure & Run
Open the app.py file in any code editor (VS Code, Notepad, etc.).

Modify the User Inputs section at the very top of the file to test different scenarios:

```
# --- USER INPUTS ---
MY_EXAM = 'COMEDK'   # Options: 'KCET', 'COMEDK', 'JEE'
MY_MARKS = 115       # Enter your marks here
```
Execute the script in your terminal:

```
python app.py
```
🚀 Future Roadmap
We are actively working on the following features for the V2 release:

🪑 Seat Matrix Integration: Dynamic adjustment of admission probabilities based on the total live seat availability.

🏷️ Category Support: Adding granular cutoffs for SC, ST, OBC, and Hyderabad-Karnataka (371J) quotas.

🌐 Web Interface: Porting the logic to a Streamlit or Flask web application for public, browser-based access.

⚠️ Disclaimer
Please Read Carefully:

Predictive Nature: This tool uses statistical modeling. Actual ranks depend on the number of test-takers and the specific difficulty distribution of the 2026 paper.

Data Validity: Cutoff data is strictly from the 2025 Round 3 cycle. Admission trends may shift in 2026 due to new policy changes or seat additions.

Advisory: Use this tool for strategic planning, but always rely on official counseling brochures for final decision-making.

Developed with precision using the Python Science Stack.
